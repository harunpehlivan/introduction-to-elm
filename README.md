# Elm: A Beginners' Guide to Elm and Data

## Why Elm?

Web front end development has gone from playing around with jQuery in the vague hope it'll work on IE6 as well as Firefox 1 to a giant fabulous, frenetic, unbelievably powerful ecosystem awash with fatigued developers.

The history of compile to JS languages is not a tale of glory either, with Dart having small take-up and CoffeeScript fading away amongst the hundreds that have cropped up and stalled, until now.

Elm is a delightful functional programming language for developers of all abilities to build a great front end...with type safety! Let Luke give you a rundown of the benefits in the first video in our new Elm stream.
